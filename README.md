# Task Manager

A personal project Developed with typescript. Organizeand your tasks, implementing drag & drop from one list to another.

#### Typescript, CSS

My goal was to get to know typescript better, get comfortable with the OOP approach using classes.
I wanted to dive into typescript without any distractions from framewoks. So, I got more familiar with types of web events, handling the DOM with typing, using classes,
I got to know the strength & restrictions of Typescript, had the pleasure of debuging with typescript's help and appreciate the frameworks' strength.

Typescripts is strict but a good friend.

I'm available for any questions or ideas to improve :)
